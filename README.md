## Technology Used:
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Tackling the problem
- Wireframming(analog white board), pseudocode, and class lectuares
- Played game online to think about steps and logic used to solve problems as they arise
- I made an array of all winning combinations and then targeted those combinations using .forEach and then 
 .Every for the "cells" on the board to check for those combinations
- Basic CSS styling to help with user experience like hover state and shadowing of the cells were used
- D.R.Y. for easy reading of code used to the best of my ability


## User Stories
- As a user, I should be able to start a new tic tac toe game
- As a user, I should be able to click on a square to add X first and then O, and so on
- As a user, I should be shown a message after each turn for if I win, lose, tie or who's turn it is next
- As a user, I should not be able to click the same square twice
- As a user, I should be shown a message when I win, lose or tie
- As a user, I should not be able to continue playing once I win, lose, or tie
- As a user, I should be able to play the game again without refreshing the page

## Unsolved Problems
1. Much more CSS needed and a scoreboard to enhance user experience
2. Adding sounds and color patterns for colorblind users to make the page more inclusive
3. Formatting of page for look and cleanliness

## Favorite Functions
- cursor functionality when hovering over different elements and cells
