## Technology Used:
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Tackling the problem
- Wireframming(analog white board), pseudocode, and class lectuares
- I made an array of all winning combinations and then targeted those combinations using .forEach and then 
 .Every for the "cells" on the board to check for those combinations.
- Basic CSS styling to help with user experience like hover state and shadowing of the cells were used.
